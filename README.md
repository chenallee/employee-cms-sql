## final thoughts:
As with every new lesson, I'm trying to learn by implementation which sometimes leads to overuse. One thing I probably overused here is promises and async/await. I'm starting to understand it a little bit better, so I think as I play around with new ways of writing asynchronous code I can learn how to better implement it.

This app, especially in the app.js file, ended up being a lot more lines of code than I had anticipated. Because of that I am really starting to see the importance of writing less but more efficient code.

There are lots of ways I can rewrite the code to be less repetitive, one of which is writing more general SQL queries. Another is that I reused all but a few context-specific words in some similar functions, like the delete functions. I could have constructed classes for each table and extended their methods. Rather than two separate queries for selecting different . I'd like to go back and implement these rewrites. Although I planned out the app ahead of time, I didn't fully understand everything I'd need to do until I started writing the code so it was only then that I realized I could rewrite it to be less repetitive. I feel like I am in a better place to both plan better and be more flexible in changing things in the future.
